Question 5
The Rotation Policy
English Team has now adopted a rotation policy for two of their players: Dom and Leach. On the first day, both of them played but, from the second day onwards, Dom plays every second day, while Leach plays every third day.

For example, on Day 1 - Both, Day 2 - Neither of them, Day 3 - Dom, Day 4 - Leach, Day 5 - Dom, Day 6 - Neither of them, Day 7 - Both.. and so on.

Find the number of days in the interval [A, B] (A and B, both inclusive) when neither Dom played nor Leach.

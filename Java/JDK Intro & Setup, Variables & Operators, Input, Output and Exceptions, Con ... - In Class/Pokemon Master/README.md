Question 12
Pokemon Master
Sara wants to become a pokemon master so she invented a strategy to choose only one type of pokemon which has very high attack power and very weak defense. i. e in a fight with this type of pokemon whoever attacks first will win. A pokemon battle goes in turns(i. e at each turn one player will attack) and Sara always goes first. Given the number of pokemon of Sara and his opponent as A and B, your task is to tell whether Sara is going to win or not.

Question 2
Dark Theme
Have you seen the different themes of the editors? There's light theme, and there's dark theme. We will be building today a toggle theme functionality where we will click a button to change the theme from dark to light.
The HTML and CSS is already provided to you.

The p element should have the text I am a Newton School student, ready to become an awesome full stack developer

The main div should have id="app" and class="day"

The button should have id="swap" and class="button_day"

Write the swapTheme function to change the classes of the div with id="app" and the button with id="swap"
